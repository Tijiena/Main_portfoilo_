        <h1>New York Times Title Design</h1>
       
        <p>The goal of this project is to create a unique player control other than simply walking around. Our design goal is to make a fast paced flying movement game. Players should be able to feel the satisfaction of speed when they are controlling the movement of the airplane crossing through the skyscrapers. Our aesthetic goal wants to recreate the scene of morning foggy high altitude when the sun just rises, and the top of the skyscraper shows above the clouds. </p>

        <h3>A Hacker, By Many Other Names</h3>
        <p>
            A Hacker, By Many Other Names is an article that talks about hackers who have a stereotype of stealing privacy information and breaking down internet safety. However, a hacker is also just someone who is really good at coding. They can use their power to educate or protect the safety across the internet, so we should link the negative connotation with the word, Hacker.

        <h3>The Moon May Get Its Own Time Zone</h3>
        <p>The Moon May Get Its Time Zone is very straight forward. Because the time on the moon is different from earth, and when we discover more information about the moon, the necessity of giving the moon a time zone increases as well.  </p>
