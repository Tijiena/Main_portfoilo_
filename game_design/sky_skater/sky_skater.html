        <h1>Fragment Island</h1>
        <p>During the first semester of my junior year, the syllbus asks us to make one game per week in order to discover what we really like and possibilities within games. We are given a word or a phrase every week as the theme, and use that to make a short prototype. At the end of semester, I was able to finish 12 games within less than 4 months. Based on this process, we can better decide what we want do in game industry.  </p><br><br>

        <h2>Inspiration and the purpose of this game</h2>
        <p>
            This walking sim project started as the first assignment for my core environmental game design class, and my inspiration comes from a <em>short comic</em> I had seen years a ago. It is a linear narrtive story, but after I scroll to the end and finish watching the comic, I found out the story also works from bottom to up. This leaves a strong impression to me, so I want to make a similar kind of story telling in this given prompt.

             In this game, the player has to make a choice at the start of the game which is to enter either <em id="green">forest door</em> or <em id="grey">sci-fi lab door</em>. Once the choice is made, the door will be closed, and there is no way to go back. There are basically three different landscape in the scene, which are forests, desserts, and sci-fi lab. If enter from the forest door, the player will go though the forest first, and seen forest turning into dessert, and sci-fi lab being built on top of that. But if the player go throught the sci-fi lab, the player will be dessert turning into the forest using the technology developed by the lab. The storytelling of the game is based on the <em>choice player have to make at first.</em> That is when player go back to the place they started, the instruction on the wall changed from choice your side to pick your story. These are intentions for this game.</p>
