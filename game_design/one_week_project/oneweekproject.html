        <h1>One week project</h1>
        <p>During the first semester of my junior year, the syllbus asks us to make one game per week in order to discover what we really like and possibilities within games. We are given a word or a phrase every week as the theme, and use that to make a short prototype. At the end of semester, I was able to finish 12 games within less than 4 months. Based on this process, we can better decide what we want do in game industry.  </p><br><br>

        <p>The theme for Week7 is one. My inspiration is that there are a lot of games that have the humor of making the main character extremely weak, so they will die at points you didn’t consider which is funny. Art style I thinking of is old rpg maker games. I want this game to be hard and overwhelming, the trap is everywhere, and you have to be careful to keep the character alive. As the result, the way I respond to the theme is my character only has one health left, anything can kill him very easily, like hunger and a rock. </p>

        <p>I learned that building up a world using a spirit sheet is not easy, the scene can get very messy pretty quickly, so organizing and naming becomes very important when building a complicated map. I also learnt how to use animators and had a better understanding of how animation works.

        <p>For the theme Level II, we can revise any game we made in previse week. I chose in view to revise. Because I like the aesthetic I drew and the photo taking function. When brainstorming this game, I circled around the idea of how to be a better bird photographer. And I made these elements into three mini games. The three mini games are to take a photo of the bird closest to the center, take a photo with most birds, and find the most number of birds in a limited amount of time.

        <h1>Responsibilities</h1>
        <p>Team Size: 1 (solo project)<br>
        -manage three mini game into different scene and organizing them together for the score caculation<br>-illstruation for all the assets<br>-code for taking image<br>-code for click to find bird within image<br>-code for caculation how many birds are remaining in the frame</p>
        <h1>Reflections</h1>
        <p> For find the most bird, I did a similar game with leaving home, so it was not very difficult for me. And calculating the distance between the bird and the center point is quite easy as well. As a result, the hardest part remains to be what I wanted to do in the beginning, and avoiding a lot of coding problems happening in the last time, like birds behind the tree will still be counted, and everything is generated at once. Gladly, I think this time, the final result is much closer than what I want to achieve, the movement of the bird feels more natural, and I found another way to calculate the number of birds within a frame. 
        </p>
