        <h1>One week project</h1>
        <p>During the first semester of my junior year, the syllbus asks us to make one game per week in order to discover what we really like and possibilities within games. We are given a word or a phrase every week as the theme, and use that to make a short prototype. At the end of semester, I was able to finish 12 games within less than 4 months. Based on this process, we can better decide what we want do in game industry.  </p><br><br>

        <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Team Size: 1 (solo project)<br>
        -code for detecting electric signal in arduino<br>-use conductive thread ,adafruit flora, and plushies to make outside controllers<br>-code for recorgnizing arduino information in unity<br>-code for displaying image and check answer when the count down turns into zero<br>-take picture for the plushies and make them into silhouette</p>
        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>My original idea is to recreate Who’s that Pokemon scene in the pokemon anime, which basically is using silhouette to guess what is actuarial pokemon. However, it is impossible to have so many toys like pokemon as physical controllers. So in order to make the project within my scope, I decided to make this game with three plushies. Three plushies are obviously not enough and way too easy to guess, so I band the plushies into forms that are hard to guess as silhouette. Just in case of the final product, I think the silhouette can be a lot harder. By observing others playing my game, most people guessed every one of it correctly.
