        <h1>One week project</h1>
        <p>During the first semester of my junior year, the syllbus asks us to make one game per week in order to discover what we really like and possibilities within games. We are given a word or a phrase every week as the theme, and use that to make a short prototype. At the end of semester, I was able to finish 12 games within less than 4 months. Based on this process, we can better decide what we want do in game industry.  </p><br><br>

        <p>The theme for Week7 is one. My inspiration is that there are a lot of games that have the humor of making the main character extremely weak, so they will die at points you didn’t consider which is funny. Art style I thinking of is old rpg maker games. I want this game to be hard and overwhelming, the trap is everywhere, and you have to be careful to keep the character alive. As the result, the way I respond to the theme is my character only has one health left, anything can kill him very easily, like hunger and a rock. </p>

        <h1>Responsibilities</h1>
        <p>Team Size: 1 (solo project)<br>
        -code and animator arrangement for walking animation<br>-code for hunger and stamina increase and decrease<br>-cut the spirit sheet into pieces and arrangeing the map</p>
        <h1>Reflections</h1>
        <p>I learned that building up a world using a spirit sheet is not easy, the scene can get very messy pretty quickly, so organizing and naming becomes very important when building a complicated map. I also learnt how to use animators and had a better understanding of how animation works.
